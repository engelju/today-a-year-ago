# today-a-year-ago
Displays what you listened to around this day for the past few years (since you registered on lastfm).

![How it could look like](https://github.com/engelju/today-a-year-ago/blob/master/a%20year%20ago.png)
(could look like this, for example)

## A couple things
1. Replace `$LASTFM_API_KEY` and `$LASTFM_USER` to your last.fm API KEY and your last.fm username. You can get yourself a last.fm API KEY (http://www.lastfm.de/api/account/create)[here].
2. Replace `$reg_year` with the year you registered on last.fm (*todo: use API for that*)
2. Yes, it's messy. It is only a small hack, because I was wondering to what songs/artist I had been listening to around this day the last few years.
